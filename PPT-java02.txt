Assignment-2

1. In Java, conditional operators, also known as ternary operators, are operators that allow you to evaluate a condition 
   and choose one of two possible values based on the result of the condition. The conditional operator in Java is represented by the question mark (?) 
   and the colon (:) symbols.

2. Unary Operator
   Binary Operator
   Ternary Operator
   Arithmetic Compound Assignment Operators.

3. The switch statement in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to select one of many possible code blocks to execute based on the value of an expression.
   It provides a concise and efficient way to handle multiple branches of execution.

4 .In Java, conditional statements are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. The main conditional statements in Java are:
     * if
     * else if-else
     * if-else if-else

5. Syntax of if-else
   if (condition) {
    // code to execute if the condition is true
   } else {
    // code to execute if the condition is false
   }

6. In Java, comparison of two strings done by using the equals() method or the compareTo() method and == opeartor. 

7. In Java, strings are immutable, which means their values cannot be changed once they are created. 
   However, the StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes in Java provide mutable string objects.
   These classes allow you to modify the contents of the string without creating a new object each time.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "programming";
        
        char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
     
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < chars.length - i - 1; j++) {
                if (chars[j] > chars[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap characters
                    char temp = chars[j];
                    chars[j] = chars[j + 1];
                    chars[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        String sortedStr = new String(chars);
        System.out.println("Sorted String: " + sortedStr);
    }
}

9. public static void main(String[] args) {
        String word = "Ineuron";
        
        if (word.contains("e")) {
            System.out.println("The letter 'e' is present in the word.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The letter 'e' is not present in the word.");
        }
    }

10.In Java, the string constant pool is a part of the runtime constant pool, which is a special area in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory.
   It is a pool of unique string literals that are used throughout the application.
   The string constant pool is typically located in the method area of the JVM's memory.
